		<h1> Thoughts of a Fleeter </h1>
		<h2> A blog by <span id = "name"> Aakash Athawasya </span></h2>
		<p id = "opening-para"> Hey there! My name is Aakash Athawasya and this is my blog. I just readlised the last two sentences you read said the same thing. Well, that's probably my blog in a nutshell. 
		No! It's not that I repeat things, well I do that to some extent. But more importantly, I just write. Write whatever comes to my mind. This is a cacophony of 'brain dumps' if you will.
		I know this introduction is not the best, and I wouldn't blame if you if you closed the tab already, or thinking of at least. I'll edit this introduction someday. But till then I'll just say
		this blog is basically a way for me not to 'keep my thoughts locked in my head,' and instead put them out there. <br> And if anyone reads them, well that's a bonus for me! </p>
		<h3 class = "blog-title"> Blog 1: <span id = "name"> Think. Learn. Educate <span> </h3>

		<p class = "para"> I write this post as a message-in-the-bottle for my future self. Whatever you are doing with your life, make sure you can — think learn and educate. <br><br>
		The job you take in the future should involve all these aspects. Not one. Not two. All three. If you find more to add to this list, feel free.<br> <br>
		<span id = "key"> Think.</span> Whatever you do, make sure it stems from thought. Your thought. Nobody else can do it besides you. If someone else can do exactly what you’re doing. You’re in the wrong job. Get out while you can. Find something else. Make it your own. <br>
		Don’t ever take this like you’re better than everyone else. You aren’t. Maybe what you do is worse. But no one can do it better.<br> <br>
		Whatever you do you should be allowed to think. To use what you’ve learned, what you've trained for since you were born. Whatever it may be. It isn’t some skill or craft you learned in a 3-month crash-course. You were molding it since you were a child.<br>
		You have to think. Livelihood or not. <br><br>
		<span id = "key"> Learn.</span> In the words of David Goggins “You have never fucking arrived.” With the work you do, there is always something to learn. You have never learned everything there is. If you have, leave. Go somewhere where the learning continues. <br><br>
		This will allow you to be humble. To always be willing to bow down, become a student and listen. When you do, be open. Don’t judge for knowing less or more. Take it head-on, ask questions and move on. <br><br>
		It is continuous. You cannot take a break from it. Everything around you is a teacher. Within your workplace, you need to learn from everything and everyone, until you become a master or a student of the craft. <br>
		Your mind never stops. So does learning. <br><br>
		<span id = "key"> Educate.</span>There is no point in keeping everything to yourself. You have to spread it with the world. <br>
		If there is something only you know, it becomes your duty to spread it. To educate people is the highest calling. Whatever you do, you should be able to help people do the same.<br><br>
		Thinking and learning are nothing without the ability to impart this to other willing people. And if you’re saying that I can’t educate people in my thinking and my learning, well then, you’ve finally got it. <br>
		Congratulations. </p>
