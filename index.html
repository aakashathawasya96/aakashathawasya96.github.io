        <h3"heading"> Emotional Energy: USE IT! </h3>
            <p> I want to preface this by saying - I'm no psychologist and I don't claim this to be a universal psychological trait, maybe just an anecdotal one. <br>
                Do you ever feel like you're expending energy during your workouts? Like you're actually feeling an emotional reaction by lifting the weights? 
                Catching your breath as the cars whizz past? Feeling giddy with pride when you reach for breath out of the water, after a quicj 1 miler? <br>
                There's a sense of emotional expenditure there, well at least for me. And in this emotional expenditure, there is an energy spent. Energy 
                that isn't just physical, measured in sweat, and heartbeats. Energy that when pushed to the limits, represents itself in blood and tears. 
                But energy that is build you for the highs and lows of life. [I know it sounds corny, but hear me out!] </p>
